this prog' is drawing shapes in the console by capturing input from the user also does arithmetic operations
between shapes using shared pointers.
 and check all the exception can be in our prog' 
and using in exeption of libary :
exception of memory , exception of invalid argument,
exception of reading from file ,exeption of out of range  
etc... 
Rectangle, Triangle,circle
